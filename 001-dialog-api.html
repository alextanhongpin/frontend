    When implementing a dialog, it is important to consider the most appropriate
    place to set user focus. When using HTMLDialogElement.showModal() to open a
    , focus is set on the first nested focusable element. Explicitly indicating
    the initial focus placement by using the autofocus attribute will help
    ensure initial focus is set on the element deemed the best initial focus
    placement for any particular dialog. When in doubt, as it may not always be
    known where initial focus could be set within a dialog, particularly for
    instances where a dialog's content is dynamically rendered when invoked, the
    element itself may provide the best initial focus placement. Ensure a
    mechanism is provided to allow users to close the dialog. The most robust
    way to ensure that all users can close the dialog is to include an explicit
    button to do so, such as a confirmation, cancellation, or close button. By
    default, a dialog invoked by the showModal() method can be dismissed by
    pressing the Esc key. A non-modal dialog does not dismiss via the Esc key by
    default, and depending on what the non-modal dialog represents, it may not
    be desired for this behavior. Keyboard users expect the Esc key to close
    modal dialogs; ensure that this behavior is implemented and maintained. If
    multiple modal dialogs are open, pressing the Esc key should close only the
    last shown dialog. When using , this behavior is provided by the browser.
    While dialogs can be created using other elements, the native element
    provides usability and accessibility features that must be replicated if you
    use other elements for a similar purpose. If you're creating a custom dialog
    implementation, ensure that all expected default behaviors are supported and
    proper labeling recommendations are followed. The element is exposed by
    browsers in a manner similar to custom dialogs that use the ARIA
    role="dialog" attribute. elements invoked by the showModal() method
    implicitly have aria-modal="true", whereas elements invoked by the show()
    method or displayed using the open attribute or by changing the default
    display of a are exposed as [aria-modal="false"]. When implementing modal
    dialogs, everything other than the and its contents should be rendered inert
    using the inert attribute. When using along with the
    HTMLDialogElement.showModal() method, this behavior is provided by the
    browser.
