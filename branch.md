# Branching 

The advantage of doing frontend is that every branch can be deployed separately through github pages (or using the url naming to split them). This allows multiple branches to be deployed indepedently, and is useful when developing features using Storybook. 
This only works for application that is doing client side rendering, as server side rendering requires server deployment.
