## Date Context

- The `updated_at` hints the last edited time of an item, and can be displayed in the ui as `(edited)`.
- The `created_at` hints the creation of the item, can be useful to display a label `New` next to the item to indicate that it is newly created today.


## Undo

- Add options to undo the operation.

## Tables

- Try to keep at max 4 columns - more than that is too messy.

## Icons 

- Display icons next to words. `(!) Action Required`. This is particularly useful other than given the text a different color, since some people might not be able to distinguish the color clearly.

## Colors

- prepare color palletes and give each color a name.
- standardize opacity ratio (40% etc)
- colored text could be cleaner than text with background filled
- try to keep the usage of colors to the minimum (red, black and white will normally suffice)
