# UI Thoughts

- less is more
- use less colors
- use simple font size (base 16px, 20px 24px, 28px, 32px, 36px)
- use simple spacing (20px or 40px height)
- use simple grid (80px width)
- keep component's max-width up to 320px (mobile responsive)
- keep it basic (no fancy ui or component)
- accessibility over aesthetic (wai aria)
