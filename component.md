## Guideline

It is usually good to refer to existing pattern libraries or design system. Use the bare components if possible before attempting to create a custom one.

Pattern libraries:
- [semantic ui](https://react.semantic-ui.com/elements/button/
- [antd](https://ant.design/)


Design System:
- [lexicon](https://lexicondesign.io/)
- [ibm carbon](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/)

## Designing with text

Remove any UI aspect from the page first - start with text. If you can represent your page as a text-based and still be able to convey the information, it would be good enough. Some visuals can be a distraction - keep it to the bare minimum. Also, remove unnecessary visuals, not the data representation. Often times designer tends to remove the useful information just because "it doesn't fit the UI".
